a tumblr theme that currently displays static posts and has a links menu that shows when clicked.

Quick note: It really doesn't do much, but it works. I was pretty new to both html/css and tumblr's template system when I made this and I don't have too much interest in working out all the tiny design errors in this particular theme, but I wanted to leave it up for posterity's sake.
